    "background": "This project gave us the opportunity to learn how to use Github when multiple developers work on the same project. We used Github for project planning, planning out development tickets, writing user stories and development notes, and tracking each ticket throughout the development cycle. I worked on the Bio site, which displays a brief history of the band and a biography and photo of each band member, as well as the Fans page. I used CSS Flexbox for organizing our data, such as the biography cards, and For loops and template literals for displaying the data dynamically. I had fun introducing flip cards for the Bio page and learning about overlaying elements on the Fans page.",

    "background": "This project allowed us to practice our most recently acquired skills of organizing our project files based on their purpose - whether they manipulate data or control the display on a page or include code to run utilities and then import that content accordingly only when necessary. In addition, I explored some new Javascript methods, such as .reduce() and Object.values() methods , in order to group bear objects by key value to identify those with the highest fish count and dynamically update the awards list on the site. We also started writing getter and setter methods for retrieving and updating data in the data file.",

    "background": "Our conclusion to the Patterns & Tools milestone, this project was an opportunity to hone our skills of working together in the same codebase, ordering tickets as necessary based on dependencies, organizing project files into the appropriate structure following ES6 module setup, introducing SCSS extensions in our code, using jQuery more extensively, and standardizing our code by using ESLint. Project instructions can be found in the Github Project tickets here: https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-11/chatty-sundews/projects/1. My contributions to this project included:  --  The functionality to add a new message by typing in text and pressing the Enter key;  --  Validating that there is text so that blank messages do not get added to the conversation by mistake;  --  Adding the modal that gives users the ability to change the color of the font and page display;  --  Adding a Clear button to quickly delete all current messages;  --  Making message cards responsive;  --  Filtering access to deleting individual messages so that users can delete only the messages they wrote",
