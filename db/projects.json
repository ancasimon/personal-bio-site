    "briefDescription": "Our first group project was a website for a music band, using Bootstrap, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript, and learning how to manage calls for multiple HTML pages in a single Javascript file.",
    "background": "This project gave us the opportunity to learn how to use Github when multiple developers work on the same project. We used Github for project planning, planning out development tickets, writing user stories and development notes, and tracking each ticket throughout the development cycle. I worked on the Bio site, which displays a brief history of the band and a biography and photo of each band member, as well as the Fans page. I used CSS Flexbox for organizing our data, such as the biography cards, and For loops and template literals for displaying the data dynamically. I had fun introducing flip cards for the Bio page and learning about overlaying elements on the Fans page.",

    "background": "This project helped solidify my knowledge of several tools and technologies: - CSS and Bootstrap tools specifically (in particular, Flexbox for organizing content, the accordion component for accessing data inputs, modals for prompting the user with alerts about data required in the form inputs, forms and their own quirks - such as preventing the default behavior of a form upon submission, progress bars and displaying the data that controls them); - New coding requirements, such as creating new objects, calling arrays within arrays, and applying event listeners; - Using additional Javascript methods such as .findIndex(), .filter(), .reset() for a form and Math.random(); - Starting to use jQuery library; - Using FontAwesome to make logo and button icons more visually appealing; - Using Google photos to ensure my personal images would get displayed correctly",

    "background": "This project allowed us to practice our most recently acquired skills of organizing our project files based on their purpose - whether they manipulate data or control the display on a page or include code to run utilities and then import that content accordingly only when necessary. In addition, I explored some new Javascript methods, such as .reduce() and Object.values() methods , in order to group bear objects by key value to identify those with the highest fish count and dynamically update the awards list on the site. We also started writing getter and setter methods for retrieving and updating data in the data file.",
