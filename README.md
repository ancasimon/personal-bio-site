# Anca Simon Personal Bio Site

## Description
This is my personal portfolio site. It allows visitors to my site to learn about my background, find out why I am a software developer today, and get a glimpse of the projects I have developed as a student at the Nashville Software School. This site also showcases the technologies and tools we have learned during our NSS 12-month intensive bootcamp program.
