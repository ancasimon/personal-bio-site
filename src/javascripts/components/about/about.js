I had been a business analyst for a few months and written specs already for lots of little enhancements. Writing, testing, releasing, and training others on each of them had been exciting.</p>';

There had been nothing, and now there was something - something I had envisioned and first put on paper. To be clear, it was most definitely not just my work. We had had lots of meetings with  clients, developers, my fellow BAs and my direct manager, who were instrumental in helping shape my thinking and our project. And then we had more meetings with customers to review mockups. And more tweaks. Numerous times.</p>';

  domString += '<p class="card-text text-center">Yet, that moment of seeing something come out of nothing (in some ways) was remarkable. It was followed by much harder work - many sprints, many reviews, many edits, much testing. Watching our users envision the future benefits of this new feature always reminded me of that early first demo and my own surprise and delight. Thatâ€™s why I am pursuing the developer role today. I plan to combine my previous skills and experience with what I am learning now so that I can continue to contribute in solving big and small business and technical problems.</p>';
